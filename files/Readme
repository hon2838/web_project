1.User Authentication:

Implement a login system (index.php) where users can authenticate using their username and password.
Include a registration page (register.php) for new users to create accounts.
File Management:

2.Develop a dashboard (dashboard.php or file_manager.php) as the main interface after login.
Allow users to upload files (upload.php) which are stored in a directory (files/).
Display uploaded files with options to download and delete them.
User Interface and Interaction:

3.Use Bootstrap (css/bootstrap.css) for styling the user interface to ensure responsiveness and visual appeal.
Provide user-friendly messages for successful and failed operations (e.g., file uploads, deletions).
Session Management:


4.Establish a MySQL database connection (includes/db_connection.php) to store user credentials securely and manage file uploads.
Functional Requirements:

5.Upon successful login, redirect users to the dashboard or file manager page.
Implement a logout feature (logout.php) to end the session and redirect users to the login page.
